# Selection problem
Randomised selection algorithm to find i-th statistic (= i-th smallest element) of array.

Algorithm paradigm: divide-and-conquer  
Time complexity: n (average)  
Compile: g++ main.cpp -o main.out  
Run: ./main.out  
Output: display the i-th statistic (red) among random integers, checking against brute-force search and sorting array
