Tournament method http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/349-Spring2010/lectures/lec03.349.pdf.

Algorithm paradigm: divide-and-conquer  
Time complexity: n  
Compile: g++ main.cpp -o main.out  
Run: ./main.out  
Output: display the largest (red) and second-to-largest (purple) integers among random integers, checking them against brute-force search
