# Floyd-Warshall algorithm
Find the all-pairs shortest path in a graph Floyd-Warshall algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm.

Algorithm paradigm: dynamic programming  
Time complexity: #edges^3 (thanks to heap data structure)  
Compile: make  
Run: ./main.out  
Output: distances from node 1 to some nodes
