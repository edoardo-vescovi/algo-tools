# Dijkstra's algorithm
Find the shortest path between nodes in a graph Dijkstra's algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm.

Algorithm paradigm: greedy  
Time complexity: #edges  * log(#edges) (thanks to heap data structure)  
Compile: make  
Run: ./main.out  
Output: distances from node 1 to some nodes
