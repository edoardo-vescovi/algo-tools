# Single-link k-clustering algorithm

The file lists the binary code of each node. The weight of each edge is the Hamming distance of the incident nodes.
The total number of edges is so large that all weights can't be calculated and stored.  

Compile: make  
Run: ./main.out  
Output: the number of clusters after joining all nodes with Hamming distance 0,1 and 2
