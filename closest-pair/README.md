# Closest pair of points problem
Find the pair of points with the smallest distance between them among a set of points https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem.
Algorithm by CLRS book.

Algorithm paradigm: divide-and-conquer  
Time complexity: n log(n)  
Compile: g++ main.cpp -o main.out  
Run: ./main.out  
Output: generate random points and return closest pair, checking it against brute-force search
